Task #1

Instructions:

In order to use this program, the user must input any double digit integer or single digit and follow it with 1 space. If the user inputs more than 1 space, it will not work. Once the user has inputted the integers, the user must press enter twice. If the user inputs a duplicated integer, then the program will crash. If the user inputs a duplicate, just re-run the program and input integers without the duplicate, so the options can be performed. In order to choose an option, the User must press either A,B, or C. After the program prompts the user to select a command, the user must press enter twice after each input for the program to run the selected options.
